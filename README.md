Welcome to the also-official list of currently open software manufacturing positions at Criipto.

You can also find a more prose-oriented variant [on our homepage](https://criipto.com/jobs/).

## The Purpose
Provide a trustworthy online existence for everyone on the planet.

## The Products
We build infrastructure components supporting our purpose.

At the heart of this are the various _electronic identity_ (aka e-ID) schemes of the world, in particular the subset of those that provide a legally valid user identifier. 

Most of these schemes are exposed over proprietary, non-standard protocols.
Criipto shrink-wraps these in an easy-to-use industry-standard interface, and also provides a self-service management interface where our customers can set up the required configuration.

## The Workplace
We favor a blend of 'at the office' and remote work - let us know what your preferences are, so we can work out the details together.
